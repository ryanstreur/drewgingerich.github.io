<h4>The Nutshell</h4>
<p>My senior year of college a great mentor helped me realize that I want to be game designer. Using the critical thinking I've developed as a scientist, I've set out to bring myself from "strangely computer illiterate millennial" to a competent game designer and programmer in my own right. I would be overjoyed to accelerate this process and work with similarly-driven people at a game studio I look up to (Riot, that's you!).</p>

<h4>Technical Skills</h4>
<h5>Software</h5>
<p>Unity, Django, Git, Linux, OS X</p>

<h5>Programming</h5>
<p>C#, Python, Bash, HTML5</p>

<h5>Things I want you to know I've learned but am not comfortable selling myself with</h5>
<p>Angular2, SQL, Javascript, Typescript, Objective-C, C, LaTeX</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<h5>Gladiatorzzz Unity Game</h5>
<p>A small turn-based combat game in an arena to learn Unity. I gave myself the constraint of finding a way to create space in combat without using physical space. I developed a combat system centered around manipulating the frequency of offense/defense cycles to create space in which to maneuver while also presenting meaningful short and long-term decisions to the player. In progress!</p>
<li>Developed a highly general combat system using C# events and reference values.</li>
<li>Created data-driven fighter and ability systems using Unity's ScriptableOjbect.</li>
<li>Focused on a decoupled, modular code architecture to ease future development.</li>


<h5>Safe Journeys Web App</h5>
<p>In light of the rising frequency of hate crimes, I have been constructing a web app to match people who want someone around as a buffer and to help deescalate situations with someone who wants to help. In progress!</p>
<li>Geopositioning-enabled backend with Django/GeoDjango and Postgresql/postgis.</li>
<li>RESTful api with Django REST framework.</li>
<li>Reactive front end with Angular2.</li>

<h4>Work</h4>
<h5>Research Assistant II:</h5>
<li>Quickly adapted to the field of electron microscopy by applying critical thinking to accelerate self-study.</li>
<li>Revitalized a stalled lab by bringing our lab's technology and techniques up to date.</li>
<li>Set up a lab supercluster environment on the OHSU Advanced Computing Cluster.</li>
<li>Created an automated image processing pipeline on the supercluster using Bash scripting.</li>

<h4>Education</h4>
<h5>Reed College, Portland, OR</h5>
<p>Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry, 2015</p>

<h4>Slice of Life</h4>
<li>Some games I like: Night in the Woods, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Dark Souls, Dokapon Kingdom.</li>
<li>I founded the Dance Dance Revolution club at Reed my senior year.</li>
<li>I like climbing things: I practice aerial silks and bouldering.</li>
<li>I love anime, but am very picky (too many tropes!).</li>
<li>I dance a lot, inspired by my favorite dancers: Les Twins and Waydi.</li>
